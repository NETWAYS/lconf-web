INSTALLATION

Requirements:

- A running web-server
- PHP >= 5.2
- php-sqlite3
- sqlite3
- php-xml
- php-xsl
- php-ldap

Installing the lconf-web standalone package is almost like icinga-web, altough you don't need database credentials, as sqlite will be used for storage:

1.) ./configure (see --help for options)

2.) make install

3.) check your permissions on app/data/lconf.db, www-user needs write permissions (to both the file AND the folder!)
