README for RHEL Packages

This package contains the Standalone Web for LConf.

The configuration files will be installed in
/usr/share/lconf-web/app/modules/LConf/config/
and not overwritten on package upgrades.

If you made any changes to the XML configuration, run the clearcache script afterwards to put them into effect.

/usr/share/lconf-web/bin/clearcache.sh
