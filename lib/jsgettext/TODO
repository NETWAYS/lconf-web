I thikn Gettext.js's references to this.context_glue are wrong... that's not
an instnace varialbe, but a class variable.

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt is the json spec
accoring to it, values in json data must be one of :
    array : []
    object: {}
    number
    string
    true
    false
    null
IE. we can't pass "undefined", we must pass "null". So, we've got some recoding.


make init method.
It should run onload
try: load language from included js script
try: load language from <link ...>
    don't load a language.

i18n calls should NOT try to load the language, but simply translate
if there is a translation, or return the english otherwise.
